Contents 1 Early life 2 Early war 3 Bir Hakeim 4 The rest of the Second World War 5 Post-war 6 Quotes 7 External links Early life [ edit | edit source ] Travers was born in London and spent her early years in England, the daughter of Francis Eaton Travers a Royal Navy admiral and his wife Eleanor Catherine (née Turnbull), until they moved to Cannes in the south of France. Never able to feel truly at home anywhere, Ms Travers had a lonely home life, feeling as though she lived in a gilded cage (privileged but trapped), with her unhappily married parents and brother.  She became what we would now call a semi-professional tennis player & whilst she did not earn from her playing, was invited to play at tournaments with all expenses covered. Her wealthy, free-spirited maiden aunt, Hilda, who had lost her love in WWI & of whom she was very fond, provided her with a monthly allowance at first, facilitating her independence from her ever-distant & disapproving parents. Early war [ edit | edit source ] At the outbreak of the Second World War , Travers joined the French Red Cross as a nurse, but later became an ambulance driver with the French Expeditionary Force to Finland's Winter War . With the German invasion of Denmark and Norway, she retreated from Denmark to Finland.  She then escaped by ship to Iceland and returned from there to England where she joined General Charles de Gaulle 's Free French forces .
By 1941, she was the chauffeur for a medical officer of the 13th Demi-Brigade of the French Foreign Legion, during the Syrian campaign in which Vichy French legionnaires fought Free French legionnaires. She was nicknamed "la Miss" by the legionnaires. She then travelled to North Africa via Dahomey and the Congo. During that journey, she had a brief affair with Georgian nobleman and Foreign Legion officer Dimitri Amilakhvari . She was then assigned as driver to Colonel Marie-Pierre Koenig and also became his lover. Bir Hakeim [ edit | edit source ] In late May 1942, as the Afrika Korps prepared to attack Bir Hakeim, Koenig ordered Travers and other women out of the area. The Germans attacked on 26 May. Not long after, Travers joined a convoy into the rear area and Koenig agreed to her requests to return to Bir Hakeim, since he felt the German attack was a failure. However, during the following fortnight, the Luftwaffe flew 1,400 sorties against the defences of Bir Hakeim, whilst four German/Italian divisions attacked on the ground. On 10 June, Travers drove Koenig's staff car during the retreat. The column ran into minefields and German machine gun fire. Koenig ordered Travers to drive at the front of the column. Travers stated: He said, "We have to get in front. If we go the rest will follow." It is a delightful feeling, going as fast as you can in the dark. My main concern was that the engine would stall. At 10:30 on 11 June, the column entered British lines. Travers' vehicle had been hit by eleven bullets, with a shock absorber destroyed and the brakes unserviceable. Her affair with Koenig ended after this battle, when he returned to his wife. The rest of the Second World War [ edit | edit source ] Travers went on to serve in Italy, France, and Germany, where she respectively drove an ambulance, lorry, and a self-propelled anti-tank gun . Later in the war, she was wounded when Koenig drove over a mine whilst revisiting Bir Hakeim in a vehicle in which she was a passenger. Post-war [ edit | edit source ] After the war she applied to and was formally enrolled in the Légion Étrangère, as an Adjutant-Chef .
Travers served in Vietnam, during the First Indochina War . She married Adjutant-Chef Nicolas Schlegelmilch, who had fought at Bir Hakeim with the 13th Demi-Brigade. They had two sons. In retirement, they lived on the outskirts of Paris. In 2000, aged 91, assisted by Wendy Holden , she wrote her autobiography, Tomorrow to Be Brave: A Memoir of the Only Woman Ever to Serve in the French Foreign Legion , having waited for all the other principals in her life story to die before writing it. Travers was decorated with the Légion d'honneur , Croix de Guerre and Médaille Militaire . Susan Travers died at the age of 94. She was survived by two sons, Francois and Thomas, and grandchildren, including two granddaughters, Adela and Eleanor.

[ UPDATED on 1/22/2021 at 8:52 PM PT ] We messed up today and you were right to let us know. Connecting and playing with friends is a vital part of gaming and we failed to meet the expectations of players who count on it every day. As a result, we have decided not to change Xbox Live Gold pricing. We’re turning this moment into an opportunity to bring Xbox Live more in line with how we see the player at the center of their experience. For free-to-play games, you will no longer need an Xbox Live Gold membership to play those games on Xbox. We are working hard to deliver this change as soon as possible in the coming months. If you are an Xbox Live Gold member already, you stay at your current price for renewal. New and existing members can continue to enjoy Xbox Live Gold for the same prices they pay today. In the US, $9.99 for 1-month, $24.99 for 3-months, $39.99 for 6-months and $59.99 for retail 12-months. Thank you. Since we launched Xbox Live (18 years ago!), we’ve been working to make it the most advanced multiplayer network available, for the greatest community of gamers — and there are a lot of you. Millions of people come together on Xbox to play with friends and discover great games. We invest in our community by strengthening the digital safety of our players, enabling new ways to share, communicate and play with your friends, and delivering industry leading reliability across our network. Periodically, we assess the value and pricing of our services to reflect changes in regional marketplaces and to continue to invest in the Xbox community; we’ll be making price adjustments for Xbox Live Gold in select markets. In many markets, the price of Xbox Live Gold has not changed for years and in some markets, it hasn’t changed for over 10 years. So, what does this mean for you? If you’re an existing online 12-month or 6-month Xbox Live Gold member, there’s no price change. If you choose to renew your membership, it will renew at your current price. The price of a 1-month Gold membership is increasing $1 USD and the price of a 3-month membership is increasing $5 USD or the equivalent amount in your local market. If you’d like to upgrade your Gold membership to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate your remaining Gold time will also convert directly to Ultimate (up to 36 months). For example, if you have 11 months of Xbox Live Gold now, and you upgrade to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, those 11 months convert to 11 months of Ultimate at no additional cost. Members have already been notified in some regions. If you’re in a region where prices are being adjusted, you will receive an email and a message center notification over the next month letting you know what the new pricing is for your membership. Going forward, new pricing will be 1-month for $10.99, 3-months for $29.99, and 6-months for $59.99, or your local market equivalent. You can always visit your account to manage your membership, and prices won’t adjust until at least 45 days after you receive the messages.

THERE WAS FURTHER controversy this week around the planned Olympic Games in Tokyo, after its chief organiser faced pressure to resign over sexist comments . There have been conflicting reports in recent weeks as to whether the Olympics – which were postponed last year – will go ahead this year as the pandemic still rages across the world. London 2012 chief Sir Keith Mills last month said if he was in the shoes of the Tokyo organisers, he’d be making cancellation plans . Organisers, however, have insisted there’s no truth to reports the event will be cancelled . A recent poll found 80% of people in Japan want the games cancelled or postponed, as several parts of the country remain under a virus state of emergency.

WHAT YOU ARE TRULY BETTING ON IS OTHER PEOPLE. I WONT TRY TO CONVINCE YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY. THIS IS MY SPECULATION, MY OPINION  AND IT VERY WELL COULD BE WRONG Hello all, I wanted to post last night as many of you commenters have asked for however my building lost power and it was absolutely awful. I am currently a refuge and my ladies house and wanted to get this out to the world. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, but more importantly this is all simply speculation. If anyone wants to make counter claims they are more than welcome but word of advice to all readers. If anyone is claiming that they know exactly what is going to happen...they are lying. There simply isn't enough current data to push this either direction. I am a bull, big time and I would like to explain why. First let's talk about yesterday There are a lot of claims of short ladder attacks and the counter-claim is that it was MM's moving the price down. One thing appears certain, there is some sort of manipulation happening in an attempt to drive the price down. Whether this is MM's, HF's, or simply retail shorts and bears; there are a strange number of exchanges happening in a clear effort to lower the price. You can check out the real time quotes here . Another large thought about why the price should have gone up yesterday was because of the options thats expired Friday 1/29 ITM. The rule is T+2 meaning these individuals have two business days to cover. Well, we expected a surge of these individuals covering and it simply never came. Everyone was glued to the screen Friday ATH waiting to see the spike of covering...but it never happened. Monday again...never happened. Tuesday...oh boy this is their last day they have to cover! Yet...they didn't. So what does this mean? Well, I see two possibilities. They somehow timed it perfectly and covered throughout the dips and spikes They haven't covered yet I'm in the camp of number 2 hence why I am a bull. If they didn't cover that results in a Failure to Deliver which you can learn about here . So what does this mean for us? Well, that would explain the tremendous price drop as FTD's create "phantom shares" a problem GME is already facing. This will dilute the price tremendously and the amount of FTD's that probably occurred would greatly dilute the price. "With forward contracts , a party with a short position's failure to deliver can cause significant problems for the party with the long position . This difficulty happens because these contracts often involve substantial volumes of assets that are pertinent to the long position's business operations." From the earlier mentioned website regarding FTD's. Now this is truly fascinating. The 2008 crisis was largely in part due to a mass number of FTD's. In fact, FTD's sometime intentionally happen...just to drive the price down for FUD so they can then cover at a better price. So if this is correct, what happens next? Well, either you can read about it here . Simply put, the individual has to close out the positions after 13 consecutive settlement days of FTD. So all this logic about T+2 was actually just the logic to begin the FTD countdown, if it hasn't already started at the beginning of this. Now, I'm not saying "nobody sold" of course people did. But volume is key and the interest in buying outweighed the interest in selling 3-1 Monday and Tuesday. Of course trades are 1-1 but interest was on the buyer side. Obviously, I don't even need to mention it but restricted trading really is what screwed this thing to begin with. My opinion? It wasn't to prevent a massive short squeeze, it was to buy them time. Today So why the hell did it spike this morning? Two reasons. RH still has 100 shares limit on GME, now for those who don't realize, that doesn't mean that is 100 shares per day. No no. The restriction is you can own up to 100 shares of GME. If you already own over 100 shares that's fine, but anyone with less than 100 shares can only add up to that amount. This restriction has not changed and other companies such as Revolut are still imposing a 100% trading restriction on GME. So what did RH offer today? The ability to purchase fractional shares, which doesn't help a whole lot but the fact that buying pressure accelerated at the notion of fractional shares shows that there is still an immense amount of buyers out there. GameStop adds new CTO to the roster, an ex AWS lead engineer. They added other executive positions as well. This further cements the change the company is taking. Now, before I get into the rest I want to address something: the fundamentals. There is a disturbing echo chamber around the idea that GameStop is a dying brick and mortar retailer and there is no chance at survival. That is simply not the case. I don't want to do a full GME DD here because this is about the second incoming squeeze. However, let me put it to you this way: If you were told that a new company was IPO'ing and it was coming to the market with an infrastructure, new talented team, 50 million customers and their plan was to become an e-commerce company to compete with Amazon; their plans for the physical locations was to be game-centric, a place for e-sports to compete, desktop building kiosks, and the newest systems and physical copies of games for those who still love having a physical copy. Not just that, but this company already has revenue share deals with Microsoft and other bigwig companies. Knowing all that information would you be interested in this company? My answer is an easy yes. The thing with digital transformation and companies changing direction is people get so lost in what the company used to be they can't see what the company is planning on becoming. If this was a brand new company that Ryan Cohen was leading with the same exact model people would be all over the concept. Enough of that. Let's talking about what is still going on today which is truly fascinating. So the good news created a large uptick follow by a combination of people escaping with whatever gains they could salvage and some more clear manipulation regardless of the source. But then what? Well, after the bounce down a lot of people saw this as a fantastic buying opportunity which made it recover quickly...but then something interesting started happening. It started uptrending. Slowly. Steadily. Uptrending. Lower lows, higher highs; no sight more beautiful. My interpretation? We found the bottom of the bears attack. The news has been consistently saying the squeeze is over but one and at time they are saying their might be a second surge and their reasoning is if retailors see this price drop as a buying opportunity instead of red flags, it will surely send the price up. The logic there is simple: if people are buying stock it goes up, if people are selling, it goes down. So today is pure magic. It doesn't need to be a wild swing up to be promising. What it needs to be is slow, consistent buying pressure even during restricted trading. But all the shorts covered! Simply not true. That is a fact. All we know is what people are telling us. Melvin says they covered. It will be the third time they have claimed that. Do I think they covered? Yes, I do. Does that matter? No. Now even if Melvin and others covered and the S3 figures are right that means the guess right now is that this stock is still 57% short. Based on their Twitter this isn't including newly opened positions which anyone in their right mind would certainly open a short position when it was 3-400. They thought this bubble would pop and they would make a quick buck. They saw it get down to $85 and started celebrating...but it starting climbing...uh oh. Truth is, no one will know the real numbers until the 9th. I think it's a little too much tin foil hat to says those numbers will be misconstrued but what we have witnessed over the past few days...it's possible. So let's talk about who is currently holding GameStop. Well, a shit ton of degenerates that have lost millions of dollars and seemingly don't give a shit. They are here out of principle, truth be told, so am I. I absolutely refuse to give any shares to the shorts after the crap they pulled last week. So we have a ton of bag holders refusing to sell and a ton of people wondering if now is the time to get in for a potential epic second short squeeze. No one is going to sell at these levels. Some people here and there but it simply isn't worth it, not with so much potential for a second squeeze. So when will this second squeeze happen? If the newest shorts are smart, it already begun. If I took up a short position and saw this start climbing again after everything it has been through, you better believe I would be covering now while I have profits. Not all of them are going to do this, which is why as the price gradually rises the potential for a larger and larger squeeze is exponential. There is no telling when it will happen. It could be a slow climb for the next couple of weeks before it pops. The 9th will be a huge indicator of what is to come, if that has anywhere above 50% short interest you better believe everyone is going to hop right back into it. It could happen as early as this week. It could be post earnings when Papa Cohen tells us his majestic plans during ER. It could be that ER will actually be fantastic on 03/05 because it will have the console cycle numbers. Look at GME charts in the past, the console cycle always makes the stock pop and with all this attention that very well could be the catalyst. In summary I wanted to do deeper analysis for you all but I knew some of you were really looking forward to the next post and my thoughts regarding the situation so I wanted to get something out there. In my opinion, a second surge, a second squeeze is bound to happen. This is a buying opportunity for those who missed the first one and I think the market and stock price is reflecting that sentiment. Positions: 1100 GME @ $16 closed 500 GME @ $20 closed 50 GME @ $120 open 236 GME @ $250 open TL;DR: I have yet to see any indication or good thesis to explain why the short squeeze would be over. Even if Melvin covered and even if S3 numbers are correct at a 57% short, these are indicators of another squeeze, potentially even more epic. The bleeding days of red on Monday and Tuesday I personally think was a combination of panic selling when premarket and ATH didn't blow up due to the ITM calls and phantom shares being created due to consistent FTD's diluting the share price. I do think these FTD's were intentional and what many are perceiving as a short ladder attack is in fact the creation and purchasing of phantom shares driving the price down. If you are a bagholder, I think it wise to hold, if you have already closed your position I would consider what we are witnessing as another buying opportunity. Final disclaimer. I have already made a significant sum of money on this GME play. This post is not a hope that you will come rescue me from my bagholding status. The money I put back in was money I was willing to lose and I came back in out of principle to stick it to the man. Good luck everyone and be grateful to be alive during this time, this will go down in financial history quite possibly forever. Retail investors have more power than we think. 19.5k 9 0 0 3 3009 comments share save Reddit Premium The best Reddit experience, with monthly Coins Try Now Trending Communities r/poker 161,996 members Join r/WritingPrompts 15,089,902 members Join r/CasualConversation 1,447,959 members Join r/UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG 867,345 members Join r/rickandmorty 2,146,148 members Join Popular Communities See more Gaming See more Sports See more TV See more Travel See more Health & Fitness See more Fashion See more help Reddit App Reddit coins Reddit premium Reddit gifts Communities Rereddit Top Posts Topics about careers press advertise blog Terms Content policy Privacy policy Mod policy Reddit Inc © 2021.

REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson Microsoft president Brad Smith defended the company's political contributions, CNBC reported. Microsoft paused donations amid criticism of its gifts to GOP lawmakers who objected to election results. But Smith said donations are vital for getting invited to events so Microsoft can lobby lawmakers. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith offered his employees a candid take this week on why the company gives money to politicians, shedding light on the heated debate over how corporate America should respond to GOP-led efforts to overturn the results of the US presidential election. "It plays an important role. Not because the checks are big, but because the way the political process works," Smith said, according to CNBC . "Politicians in the United States have events, they have weekend retreats, you have to write a check and then you're invited and participate." Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment on this story. After 147 Republican members of Congress challenged states' Electoral College votes earlier this month, on the same day protesters violently broke into the US Capitol in a deadly riot, America's biggest companies — and political spenders — faced criticism for their financial support of the lawmakers who had for months undermined confidence in the election. One of those companies was Microsoft, which has given more than $178,000 to 61 those lawmakers through its political action committee, MSPAC, during the latest election cycles — the third-most among S&P 500 companies .

But as critics noted , the company hasn't specifically committed to stop funding the lawmakers who attempted to overturn the election results — despite Smith signing a letter denouncing those efforts — effectively penalizing lawmakers who upheld the principles espoused in the letter. Smith argued to employees on Thursday that the contributions are still important because they get Microsoft's lobbyists access to politicians, which helps them build relationships so the lawmakers are more receptive when Microsoft wants to lobby them on an issue. "If you work in the government affairs team in the United States, you spend your weekends going to these events; you spend your evenings going to these dinners, and the reason you go is because the PAC writes a check," Smith said, according to CNBC. Smith added that the relationships built at these events make it more likely lawmakers will be receptive when he calls them to ask for their help on employees' immigration cases, as well as "issues around national security, or privacy, or procurement reform. Or the tax issues our finance team manages." However, Smith didn't acknowledge contributions that companies give to candidates who are up for election and depend on those contributions to help them get — or stay — in power. In 2020 alone, Microsoft gave $88,000 to lawmakers up for election who eventually objected to Electoral College results.

Smith's comments provided a more direct acknowledgment than most executives typically give about how American politics are often "pay-to-play" — particularly following the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United that allowed companies to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence politics. But they also came at a time when companies are facing unprecedented pressure from employees, customers, and shareholders , to rethink which candidates they support, who they do business with, and the positions they take on important national issues.
