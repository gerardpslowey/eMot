neutral, No . 
neutral," Www , man ! "
neutral," Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . "
neutral," I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . "

neutral, Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 . 
neutral, He is fine .

neutral, 120 yuan . 
neutral, Certainly . 
neutral, There is no need to be so frustrated . 
neutral, cool . 
neutral, All right . 
neutral, First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . Then we will visit the University Museum .

neutral, She's ten . 
neutral," Two tickets , please . How much are they ? "
neutral," Ho , no ! "
neutral," Uh , yes . "
neutral, Yes . 
neutral, Good idea . 
neutral, Positive 。 
neutral, No joke ! 
neutral," the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . "
neutral, So what's the problem ? 
neutral, My parents . 
neutral," Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . "

neutral," You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? "
neutral, Um . 
neutral, But I don't think it's so nice . 
neutral, I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day .

neutral, Yes . 
neutral," No , what ? "
neutral,It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . 
neutral, Not only that !

neutral, She loves to nitpick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . 
neutral, Only one . 
neutral, But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless . 
neutral," Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . "
neutral, A second language is always difficult . 
neutral, I guess so . 
neutral, why ?

neutral," Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? "
neutral, What ? 
neutral, Could you move smoothly ? 
neutral, Oh . 
neutral, OK . 
neutral, What is it ? 
neutral,So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ? 
neutral, Exactly . 
neutral, Tell me ! Tell me ! What's your secret ? ! 
neutral, I would think this was the least they could do . 
neutral, I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . 
neutral, do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ’ d love to see it . 
neutral, I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . 
neutral, See you . 
neutral, See you .
