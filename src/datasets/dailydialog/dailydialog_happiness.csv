happiness,"I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida . "
happiness, That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there . 
happiness,I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article . 
happiness, A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it . 
happiness, Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother . 
happiness,Thanks for coming shopping with me . 
happiness, I'm so honored that you thought to ask me . 
happiness, I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before . 
happiness, You're going to do great . And you're going to look great . 
happiness, Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion . 
happiness, I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you . 
happiness, We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year !

happiness, I will ! I could use some good luck ! 
happiness," Well , I wish you luck here . "
happiness, I ’ m sure I ’ ll like it here . 
happiness,"It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . "
happiness," I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . "
happiness," I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . "
happiness, The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . 
happiness, You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! 
happiness, That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else . 
happiness, Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done .

happiness," You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? "

happiness," Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . "
happiness," Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . "

happiness," Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . "

happiness," Yes , it is . The sun is shining . There is no wind , only a pleasant breeze . "
happiness," Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . "
happiness," It's interesting , I like being an editor . "
happiness," I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . "
happiness, I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . 
happiness," Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . "
happiness, That's perfect . I will definitely do well . 
happiness, I'm honored to know you . 
happiness,"Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your new neighbor . My name is Andy . "
happiness," Hi , Andy . I'm Judy . It's nice meeting you . "
happiness," Nice meeting you , too . "
happiness, Come over and visit when you have time . 
happiness, Thanks for the invitation . I will ! 
happiness, That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ? 
happiness, Something like listening to music is a good idea . 
happiness, Classic . Something that could calm your mind . 
happiness, I think that might work for me as well . 
happiness,"Mrs.Smith , time has stood still with you ! "
happiness, Thank you.You ' re partial . 
happiness, I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day . 
happiness, It's nice to hear that anyway .

happiness, That ’ s a good way to think about it . 
happiness, Thanks a lot . 
happiness, You are welcome . 
happiness, Good . I know that you are capable of being an excellent student . 
happiness," That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . "
happiness, Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job . 
happiness, That would really help me a lot . I'm very grateful . 
happiness, Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students .

happiness," Good , happy birthday to you ! "
happiness," Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? "
happiness," Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . "
happiness, My pleasure . 
happiness,Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person ! 
happiness," Hello sir . Good to meet you , too . "
happiness, Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night ! 
happiness," We do many things . In the morning , we go swimming and boating . In the afternoon , we play basketball or tennis . We sit around a camp fire at night.We sing or tell stories . "
happiness, That sounds wonderful . 
happiness," You too , Peter . Give my regards to John . I'll see you in September . "
happiness, I heard it ’ s a very good movie . 
happiness, Wonderful . I ’ m so excited . 
happiness,How time flies ! 
happiness, May and Danny have already grown up . 
happiness, I can still remember our first date . 
happiness, Look at that big tree over there . 
happiness," Yeah , oh my god ! It's still there . We have our first date right on there . "
happiness, Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight . 
happiness, You were dull at that time . 
happiness, But you agreed to go out with me at last . 
happiness, I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married . 
happiness," Sounds good , when ? "
happiness, Never mind . I'll be waiting for you . 
happiness, See you then .

happiness," I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home . "
happiness," Oh , it's no problem.It ' s OK.You know , it only happened once . "
happiness, I am glad we've straightened everything out . 
happiness, I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college . 
happiness, That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby . 
happiness, Hobbies are never too late to learn . They offer a variety of classes at the local community college . You should look into it . 
happiness, I think I will . Thanks for the info . 
happiness,Hey Jane . How are you doing these days ? 
happiness, Hi Martha . Everything is perfect . 
happiness, Are you enjoying married life ? 
happiness, It couldn't be better . My husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much . 
happiness, You're so lucky . I hope to get married to a guy like that . 
happiness," I'm so happy . Even though we are both working , we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends . "
happiness, Do you guys do anything special ? 
happiness," In the evening , we just sit and talk over dinner . But on the weekend , we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant , or go to a nice cafe . "
happiness, Sound like everything is great . 
happiness,"Look , Forest Gump is on at six thirty . "
happiness," Yeah , I am very impressed with Tom Hanks ' performance in the movie . "
happiness, I am also impressed with the lines in the movie . 
happiness," Life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you're gonna get . "
happiness, That's my favorite . 
happiness, It deserves . That film can give us a lot of inspiration . 
happiness," Yes , the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble . "
happiness," All in all , it will never lose its appeal . "
happiness," Gucci , I have an idea . Do you want to see this movie together ? "
happiness, Sure . Now you are talking . 
happiness," Okay . BBS , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums . "
happiness," Oh , that's great . I want to try later . "
happiness, Why not ? 
happiness, Shall I say around ten o'clock ? 
happiness," Yes , I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 . "
happiness,Congratulations ! Mr . Stuart ! You won the city marathon . 
happiness, Thank you . I am very excited . 
happiness, We are all very proud of you . 
happiness," I am very happy , too . It was a big game and I won . "
happiness, I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement . 
happiness, It was really an exciting moment . 
happiness," It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . "
happiness," Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? "
happiness," Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? "
happiness, Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol ! 
happiness, That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ? 
happiness," Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . "
happiness," She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her . "
happiness, She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . 
happiness, Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books . 
happiness, ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time . 
happiness,"Mum , this is for you . "
happiness," Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ? "
happiness," Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum ! "
happiness," Oh , thank you.You are so sweet ! "
happiness,"Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? "
happiness," To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . "
happiness," The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . "
happiness," Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ? "
happiness,Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? 
happiness," I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . "
happiness," Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . "
happiness," I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . "
happiness, Yes . I am very glad to have the chance . 
happiness,I had a wonderful evening . 
happiness, Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . 
happiness," Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . "
happiness," I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . "
happiness," Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! "
happiness, Thanks so much . 
happiness, I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . 
happiness, That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ? 
happiness, Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . 
happiness,Tony looks very handsome in the suit . 
happiness, He prefers suits to jackets . 
happiness, That's wonderful . Congratulations . 
happiness," Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding . "
happiness, I'd love to . What date is it ? 
happiness, Very good ! I'm looking forward to it . Please give my best regards to John . And I wish you best luck ! 
happiness, Thanks . 
happiness,Tony looks very handsome in the suit . 
happiness, He prefers suits to jackets . 
happiness," Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil . "
happiness, yes . I bought a scarf yesterday . It's really nice and warm . Have a look . 
happiness," Oh , it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern . "
happiness," yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ? "
happiness," it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own . "
happiness, how about this blue sweater ? 
happiness, that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ? 
happiness," yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ? "
happiness, that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings . 
happiness, I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is . 
happiness, perfect ! 
happiness," you have good fashion sense , Karen . "
happiness, thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there . 
happiness," yes , but with our sense we'll always look good . "
happiness," Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there . "
happiness," Yes , I ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump . "
happiness, Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can . 
happiness," Ok , I ’ ll try my best . "
happiness," Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion . "
happiness, That's the spirit . Never give up on your dream . 
happiness,"Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ? "
happiness," Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college . "
happiness," It's nice meeting you too , Alice . "
happiness, See you around ! 
happiness," Goodbye , Alice . "
happiness, Thank you for joining the library ; we look forward to serving you . 
happiness, That ’ s a great employment benefit ! 
happiness, Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office ! 
happiness, Really ? That's really wonderful . I'm so happy for her . 
happiness," Yes , mom . You are right . Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . I will keep going . "
happiness, fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . 
happiness," that's be great . The more prepared I am , the better . "
happiness, Wow . I really like California ... the weather there is much better than the East Coast . 
happiness,"I hear you're entering the speech contest , Mike . "
happiness, That's right . I thought I'd give it a shot . 
happiness," Well , I wish you good luck ! "
happiness,What shall we do after the volleyball match ? 
happiness, How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . 
happiness, That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . 
happiness," Me , too . What did you have in mind ? "
happiness," I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . "
happiness," I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan "
happiness," Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? "
happiness," The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . "
happiness," Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? "
happiness, I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . 
happiness, Any other ideas ? 
happiness," There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . "
happiness, It all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . 
happiness,"Cindy , I heard you got into that university . Congratulations ! "
happiness, Thanks ! I'm so happy . It's like a dream come true . 
happiness, She looks very healthy.How old is she ? 
happiness, Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . 
happiness,"Hello , Julia , I know a party that will begin at midnight . Would you love to go ? "
happiness," I'd love to , but my mother asks me to go home before 11:00 every night . She will worry if I get home late . "
happiness, You're right . Mother's love is the greatest love in the world . 
happiness, Yes . How about donating some money ? 
happiness, It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ? 
happiness, Just find the answer through Internet . 
happiness," Yes , let's do it now . "
happiness, It's a good thing you can speak English ! 
happiness,I went to Jessie's birthday party yesterday . It was very good . 
happiness, I didn't know about it . What did you do ? 
happiness, We ate a lot of things . We played games and gave gifts to Jessie . We had a lot of fun . 
happiness, You were really lucky . 
happiness," My birthday comes next month . I want to hold a birthday party , too . "
happiness, I hope I can go to your party . 
happiness," She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy . "
happiness, I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life . 
happiness," She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her . "
happiness, It's been a long time ! What's new ? 
happiness, Nothing much . What about you ? Is everything going well ? 
happiness, Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii . 
happiness, I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up . 
happiness, Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye ! 
happiness," Yes , stay in touch . Bye ! "
happiness," Give me your email , would you ? "
happiness, Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com . 
happiness," Oh , that sounds great . How about 6 o ’ clock ? "
happiness, Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though . 
happiness," Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ? "
happiness," Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy . "
happiness," Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now . you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . "
happiness," Yes , of course . And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers . "
happiness, You bet . The wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it . 
happiness, Oh you ’ re so kind ! 
happiness, Get in . 
happiness, Look ! David gives his following-comment on my first blog . He is my first visitor . 
happiness,What time shall I pick you up ?

happiness," That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . "
happiness," Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then . "
happiness," Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . "

happiness, You will be very beautiful on your wedding day . 
happiness, Thank you ! 
happiness, Which hotel will the reception be held at ? 
happiness, The Palace Hotel . 
happiness," It's excellent . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . "
happiness," It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth . "
happiness, I think you made the right decision . 
happiness," Oh , so nice of you to come here . Have a seat . Please make yourself at home . "
happiness, OK . ( Sit on the sofa ) Wow ! Your house was decorated so beautiful .

happiness," Well , I think it's fabulous . And the neighbors don't even seem to exist . "
happiness, That is a relief . It's a good thing we moved . 
happiness, That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? 
happiness, Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !

happiness,"It's a lovely day , isn't it ? "
happiness," Yes , the weather sure is nice today . "
happiness, I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? 
happiness," That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . "
happiness," I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . "
happiness," Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . "
happiness,I hear that you have been promoted . Congratulations on your promotion !

happiness, Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . 
happiness, Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ?

happiness," Yes , my sister loves his personality . "
happiness," Yeah , if something is on the radio it must be really good . "
happiness, I totally agree ! 
happiness," Don't you notice that Bob has a mole on his face , but Tom does not . "
happiness, You really have keen eyes . 
happiness, I play tennis there every week . Shall we have a game one day ? 
happiness, That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink . 
happiness, Thank you for your warning . 
happiness," Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . "

happiness, Can I have a look as well ? 
happiness," Of course , have a seat . "
happiness," Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful . "
happiness," Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof . "
happiness," Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top . "
happiness," Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer . "

happiness,"Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night ! "
happiness, You mean with my performance ?

happiness,I got a raise . 
happiness, I'm glad to hear that . 
happiness, That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? 
happiness," Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . "
happiness, you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time ! 
happiness, I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice .

happiness, No problem . See you ! 
happiness, See you ! 
happiness,"Hi Amy , you look very happy . "
happiness," Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony . "
happiness, Wow . You must be very excited . 
happiness, I certainly am . I would have been very disappointed if I hadn ’ t got them . 
happiness, Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ? 
happiness, What a good idea . I'm quite hungry . 
happiness, Me too . I feel very thirsty as well . 
happiness, Let ’ s go then . 
happiness,Mary has really gotten under my skin . 
happiness, I think I ’ m crazy about her . 
happiness,I like football best of all .

happiness," thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then ! "
happiness," I'm fine . After ten years , you still look great ! "
happiness, So do you ! How are you doing ? 
happiness, That's good . Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity . It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning . 
happiness, I would buy that kind of book ! 
happiness, It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance . 
happiness," Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants . "
happiness," Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist . "
happiness, Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone . 
happiness, Obviously you did enjoy the concert . 
happiness," Yes , I did . "
happiness, Great . We can't keep up with the demand . 
happiness, Then let me take you out to dinner to celebrate . 
happiness," Nice meeting you , Kevin . I hope to see you again . "
happiness, Let's keep in touch . 
happiness," Sure , let's . Goodbye , then . "
happiness, That's fine . 
happiness,Why don't you come round for a meal one evening next week ? 
happiness, I'd love to . 
happiness, Which day would suit you ? 
happiness, Any day except Tuesday . 
happiness, How about Thursday ? 
happiness," Yes , Thursday would be fine . What time shall I come ? "
happiness," Oh , about 6:00 . Will that be OK ? "
happiness," Yes , of course . Thank you very much . "
happiness," See you on Thursday , then . "
happiness, I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you . 
happiness, You are smart . 
happiness, The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers . 
happiness," Good idea . Oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ? "
happiness," Ok , how does this sound , “ I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there . So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ” "
happiness, Nice ! Let ' s go ! 
happiness," Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . "
happiness,Great ! I landed on Classic Movies .

happiness, I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . 
happiness,Do you like swimming ? 
happiness," Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . "
happiness," Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . "
happiness," I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . "
happiness, Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? 
happiness," Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . "
happiness, Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile . 
happiness," Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team . "
happiness, And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights . 
happiness," He had great vision , didn't he ? "
happiness, And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally . 
happiness," Fine , thanks . I ’ m having several friends over for dinner this Saturday . And I was wondering if you have the time to join us . "
happiness, Sounds good . What time do you want me to come ? 
happiness, Is six o ’ clock okay ? 
happiness," ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... "
happiness," Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? "
happiness," Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . "
happiness, Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . 
happiness, OK . I'll turn it on . 
happiness, All right . It's just four o'clock . 
happiness," Well , I'm setting my watch at four . Thank you . "
happiness, You are welcome . 
happiness, That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? 
happiness, I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend . 
happiness, I'll get my things and meet you there . 
happiness, Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . 
happiness, Someone brings a truck to the game and we have a barbecue right there in the parking lot out of the back of the truck ! 
happiness, How fun ! Can I bring something ? 
happiness," Well , if you insist , you are welcome to bring a potato salad ! "
happiness, Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five ! Thank you !

happiness," Yes , it's nice and bright . "
happiness, That's quite a lovely weather . 
happiness,"What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city . "
happiness, I'm glad you like it.The bell is on the bedside.Just ring if you want anything.The room attendant speaks a little English.So I don't think you'll have any trouble . 
happiness," No , I shouldn't think so.By the way , is there a socket for my razor ? "
happiness," Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . "
happiness,You're my hero . 
happiness," Aw , shucks , ma'am . "
happiness,That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from . 
happiness," Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning . "
happiness, I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today . 
happiness," But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil . "
happiness, A match made in heaven . 
happiness, It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . 
happiness," It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . "
happiness," Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . "
happiness, Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . 
happiness, That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ? 
happiness, I'd love it . Working out is more fun with a friend . 
happiness, I'll get my things and meet you there . 
happiness, Good . If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . 
happiness,My friend Jane is very beautiful . 
happiness," Perfect . And I like her charming eyes , too . "
happiness, Dark blue . 
happiness, Twenty . 
happiness,"Nice day , isn't it ? "
happiness, Sure it is . Why don't we go to a park ? 
happiness, Good idea ! 
happiness, I'm fine . How about yourself ? 
happiness, I'm pretty good . Thanks for asking . 
happiness, I've been great . What about you ? 
happiness, I've been good . I'm in school right now . 
happiness, Good luck with school . 
happiness, Thank you very much . 
happiness, You must be lonely . I will share my friends with you . 
happiness, That's very nice of you . 
happiness, It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . 
happiness,"Wang , I'd like you to meet my friend . Dou , this is Wang . "
happiness, Hello Wang . I'm Dou . Pleased to meet you . 
happiness," Pleased meet you , too , Mr . Dou . "

happiness, Thanks for reminding me . I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too . 
happiness," Hopefully , that will keep everyone happy . "
happiness, Do you like western music ? 
happiness," Yes , I do , very much . "
happiness, There ’ s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ? 
happiness," Oh , yes . I ’ d love to . "
happiness,It was great meeting you . 
happiness, Me too . 
happiness, Maybe we can meet again sometime ? 
happiness," Of course , but I'll have to go now . "
happiness,There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month . 
happiness," My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo . "
happiness, It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food . 
happiness, I can hardly wait !

happiness," That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . We just don't have the money ! "
happiness, Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do . 
happiness, This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen . 
happiness, Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go ! 
happiness, ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . 
happiness, I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . 
happiness," That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . "
happiness," Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . "
happiness," Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? "
happiness," Yeah , I want the note . "
happiness, Have a great time tomorrow night . 
happiness, Thanks . I plan on it . 
happiness," He is tall and slim , fair-haired . "

happiness, That's what friends are for . 
happiness,How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations ! 
happiness, Thank you ! 
happiness, Fred is really a good guy . And he loves you so much . 
happiness, Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife . 
happiness," He's after your own heart , it is important . "
happiness, So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday . 
happiness, I promise ! 
happiness,"Many happy returns of the day , darling ? "
happiness, Thank you very much . 
happiness, And here is your birthday present . 
happiness, Do you like it ? 
happiness," I love it ! Darling , you ’ re kind . "
happiness," Good for you , keep it up . "
happiness,"On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . "
happiness," Yes , it's to my liking , too . "
happiness," Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? "
happiness, It's my dream . 
happiness,"Hello , Joanna . You are looking very charming in the new dress . "
happiness," Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve seen anything like it before . "
happiness, I know . That ’ s why I bought it . I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing . 
happiness," And the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously . "
happiness," It ’ s very nice of you to say so . I should say you are glamorous yourself , as a matter of fact . "
happiness, Thank you for saying so . 
happiness,Welcome back ! How was your vacation ? 
happiness," It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! "
happiness, Where did you end up going ? 
happiness," Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . "
happiness, I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? 
happiness, That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? 
happiness," We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . "
happiness, My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? 
happiness, Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . 
happiness, That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . 
happiness,Your ring is very beautiful . 
happiness, Thank you . It has been handed down in my family for three generations . 
happiness," Oh , it is precious . "
happiness, It surely is . 
happiness, I think we ’ ll benefit a lot . 
happiness," Oh , thank you very much . I ’ d like to come , but I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy that evening . "
happiness, That's great . We should visit him some time . 
happiness, Thank you ! 
happiness," Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . "
happiness,"Hey , let's go to the night market after work tonight . "
happiness, That's a good idea . I haven't been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! 
happiness, Can I get you another blanket ? 
happiness," 0h , that would be nice of you . "
happiness, I'll turn the heat up . 
happiness," Yes , please do that . "
happiness,Do bullfights interest you much ? 
happiness, Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . 
happiness, So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . 
happiness," Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? "
happiness," Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . "
happiness, Those young actors play the roles perfectly . 
happiness," No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it . "
happiness, Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . 
happiness, That ’ s sounds great . 
happiness,I like your sweater . It suits you very well . 
happiness, Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend . 
happiness, She certainly has the taste . 
happiness, You bet . I'm really excited . 
happiness, I like to play the piano for fun . 
happiness, Yeah . That can be a good hobby . 
happiness, Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . 
happiness, That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . 
happiness, It's cool . 
happiness,"Good evening , I'm so happy you could come . "
happiness, Thank you for inviting me . 
happiness, What would you like to drink ? 
happiness," A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you . "

happiness, I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . 
happiness, Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . 
happiness," To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . "
happiness, You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities .

happiness," Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? "

happiness, What does he look like ? Can people tell ? 
happiness," Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . "

happiness,"You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . "
happiness," Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . "
happiness, I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . 
happiness," Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . "
happiness,"Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . "
happiness, I've said you will enjoy your life here !

happiness, I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song . 
happiness," Besides , speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert . "
happiness," Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . "
happiness, Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? 
happiness," Yes , I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 . "
happiness," Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . "
happiness," That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever . "
happiness, Who was the conductor at that event ? 
happiness," Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday . "

happiness," Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . "

happiness, Sounds good . See you there ! 
happiness," So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! "
happiness, I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . 
happiness," Oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . "
happiness, That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! 
happiness, Thank you very much ! 
happiness,I love ice cream . 
happiness," Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . "

happiness," Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! "
happiness, Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! 
happiness," A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! "

happiness, I like lotus . 
happiness, You have a perfect taste ! 
happiness, But there aren't any lotus now . 
happiness, Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms . 
happiness, That's not bad . Let's go . 
happiness, I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it . 
happiness," So , is that a yes ? "

happiness, Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully . 
happiness," But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! "
happiness," Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself . "
happiness," Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations . "
happiness, Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit .

happiness, That sounds terrific . 
happiness," Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . "
happiness, That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . 
happiness," If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . "
happiness, I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! 
happiness,"Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ? "
happiness," Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . "

happiness,"Let me hold the door for you , miss . "
happiness, Thank you . You're very kind . 
happiness," Thank you , Mr . Parker . "
happiness, So we can relax now . 
happiness," Yeah , I could hardly wait to see it . "
happiness, It ’ s really very good . 
happiness, I'm doing business through Internet now . 
happiness," Yes , very good . "
happiness, It is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time .

happiness, Have you visited it before ? 
happiness," Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting . "
happiness, Like what ? 
happiness," It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between . "
happiness, Sounds marvelous . 
happiness, You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain . 
happiness, Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing . 
happiness,"Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . "
happiness," Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . "
happiness, That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . 
happiness, I guess I never thought of that before . 
happiness," And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . "
happiness," Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! "
happiness, That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? 
happiness," Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . "

happiness," That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . "
happiness, That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . 
happiness," Marvelous . Pass it over . My name's George , by the way . "

happiness," No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that . "
happiness, Thanks for saying . Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear ?

happiness,"Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing . "
happiness, It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult . 
happiness, They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year . 
happiness," Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers . "
happiness," Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus . "

happiness, That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . 
happiness," Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . "
happiness, Good . Let's go now . 
happiness, All right . 
happiness," Fortunately , there is no person died . "
happiness, That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake . 
happiness," Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman . "
happiness, We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake . 
happiness," Right . But people at that time only know two words , "" save "" and "" assistance "" , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else . "

happiness, OK . I'll talk to you later . 
happiness," Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together . "
happiness, Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends . 
happiness," Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything . "
happiness, That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes . 
happiness," When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her . "
happiness, It seems you two bring out the best of one another . 
happiness, Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me .

happiness, Yes ! Somebody up there loves me ! I knew it wasn't too late for snow . 
happiness," It is kind of strange though , to have snow in April , and so much of it . "

happiness, what are all they for ? 
happiness," most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places . "
happiness, I hope you are Settling in at school !

happiness, They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . 
happiness," Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital . "
happiness, What does this mean ? 
happiness," This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer . "
happiness, I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing .

happiness, Great ! That's settled then . 
happiness, OK . 
happiness, Nearly everything . 
happiness," Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . "
happiness, Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s 
happiness, Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . 
happiness, Mm . What came after that ? 
happiness," After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . "
happiness, Pretty good . Please continue . 
happiness," The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers . "
happiness, Come on . 
happiness," Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . "

happiness, That sounds great . Is it casual ? 
happiness," Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays . "

happiness,"This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move . "
happiness," Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too . "

happiness," Well , I came to know a girl three weeks ago . We have so much in common . "
happiness, So I think I may fall in love with her . 
happiness, That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ? 
happiness, Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ? 
happiness," That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . "
happiness, That's what I do . 
happiness, And you think about her all the time ? 
happiness, Yes . 
happiness," And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging . "
happiness," That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . "
happiness," Oh , congratulations . Sounds like you've found your soul mate . "
happiness," Thanks , but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another . "
happiness," Yes , that's right . If you find this person becomes more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love . "
happiness," Yeah , falling in love is so good . "

happiness," You know , now that I think about it , you might be right . "
happiness, April might be nice . It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements . 
happiness, That is a good suggestion . 
happiness, We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them . 
happiness," Yeah , that would let us know what would work best . "

happiness, Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? 
happiness," I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . "
happiness, I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . 
happiness," Oh , ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . "
happiness, Exactly . 
happiness, Do we need an appointment beforehand ?

happiness,"It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . "

happiness," Thanks , Jeanine , you are a real pal . Let's go in . "
happiness, Good luck ! 
happiness, We can hold them until one day before the show . 
happiness," All right , thank you very much . Good bye . "
happiness, You are welcome . Goodbye . 
happiness," You speak good English , though . "
happiness," Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . "
happiness, Haha . April Fool's ! Did you forget what day it is today ? 
happiness," That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ? "
happiness," I am having a party Saturday night at my house . If you have time , you should come . "
happiness, That sounds like fun . 
happiness, Great . I'll see you on Saturday . 
happiness, Ok . See you later . 
happiness,Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . 
happiness, I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . 
happiness," Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . "
happiness, I will . See you later . 
happiness,"Mike , these flowers are just gorgeous . "
happiness, I ’ m glad you like them . Happy birthday ! 
happiness, I can ’ t thank you enough . I ’ m really touched . I don ’ t know what to say . 
happiness, Forget it . It ’ s my pleasure . You mean a lot to me . 
happiness, You ’ re the best ! 
happiness,Shall we sing with a karaoke ? 
happiness, Great idea ! I do it every so often . 
happiness," For us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment . "
happiness," Yep . If you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ? "
happiness," I can not agree with you more . And if you are an awful one , that will be funny . "
happiness, I remembered Tom is always out of tune . We burst into laughter . 
happiness, Is that true ? Shall we invite him to join with us ? 
happiness, So tricky ! 
happiness, That is fine . 
happiness, Oh ! That sounds great ! How about six o'clock ? 
happiness,Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? 
happiness, Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? 
happiness," I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . "
happiness, That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? 
happiness," I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . "
happiness," If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? "
happiness," I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . "
happiness, You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . 
happiness," The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . "
happiness, The Taj it is then . 
happiness, Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? 
happiness, They'll still charge us a corkage fee . 
happiness, That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . 
happiness, Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . 
happiness," No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . "
happiness, I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! 
happiness, Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ’ s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ? 
happiness," Well , let ’ s go to the marathon tomorrow then ! We can just stand by the side of the road . "
happiness, What a great idea . 
happiness," You know , although we've chatted twice , I've been thinking of you already . "
happiness," Me too . I want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ... "
happiness," Look , I am playing the piano for you . "
happiness," Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you . "
happiness, OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you . 
happiness, Ha ! She is too little . 
happiness," Cute , like you . "
happiness, I want to tell you that I like you 
happiness, Me too . Send you a kiss ... 
happiness, Thx . 
happiness,I'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . 
happiness, I trust you ’ re keeping well ? 
happiness," I'm doing great , thank you . "
happiness, So we can get down to business . 
happiness, It's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . 
happiness, That sounds like fun . 
happiness," Hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle ! "
happiness, Thank you . I will . 
happiness," Oh , I see.Thank you . "
happiness,I hear little Bob has recovered . 
happiness, That's a great relief . I was worried about him . 
happiness, The operation was very successful . 
happiness, His parents must feel very happy . 
happiness,I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! 
happiness, Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! 
happiness," That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute ! "
happiness, He must be very brave . 
happiness, Exactly ! 
happiness,"OH , This is the famous Emperor Palace building . "
happiness, It ’ s huge . 
happiness, Would you like to go to the top ? 
happiness," Yes , of course . "
happiness, The view is breath-taking . 
happiness, Thank you very much . I really had a good time . 
happiness," Well , thank you for coming . "
happiness, So see you . 
happiness, Bye . 
happiness, Thank you very much . 
happiness,Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how have you been ? It ’ s been such a long time ! 
happiness," Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! "
happiness," Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! "
happiness," Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! "
happiness," Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . "
happiness, He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! 
happiness," Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . "
happiness, Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . 
happiness, Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! 
happiness," But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . "
happiness," Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! "

happiness, I am glad you enjoy it . I will tell this to the chef . Would you like some more beer ? 
happiness," Yes , please give me another Calsberg . "
happiness, Can I bring you some dessert ? 
happiness," No , thank you . I've had enough . "
happiness, How about some coffee or tea then ? 
happiness," Yes , I will have a cup of coffee . "
happiness, Thanks for your help . 
happiness, Ok . I ’ ll take it . 
happiness, Certainly . 
happiness,"Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ? "
happiness, I'd be glad to . I love picnicking . 
happiness," Then , put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages . "
happiness, Can I bring my camera with me ? 
happiness," Sure . Bring enough films , please . "
happiness, I sure will . 
happiness,"You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? "
happiness," Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . "
happiness," If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . "
happiness, I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . 
happiness, I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture .

happiness,Too bad you missed Jane's performance . 
happiness, It was so perfect that it won a unanimous 10 . 
happiness, Yesterday morning was beautiful I thought the sunning was going to continue . 
happiness,Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . 
happiness," Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? "
happiness," Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? "
happiness," Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . "
happiness, The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? 
happiness, Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . 
happiness," When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . "
happiness," Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will lock perfect . "
happiness, Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . 
happiness, Goodbye . Hope to see you again next year . 
happiness,Are you having a good time ? 
happiness," Oh , yes . It's a great party . There are some people I don't know , though . "

happiness," Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! "
happiness," You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . "
happiness, Good luck ! 
happiness, Thanks ! 
happiness, Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . 
happiness,Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China . 
happiness," Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red . "
happiness, That must be very beautiful . 
happiness," Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies . "
happiness, Really ? Have you ever been there ? 
happiness, A couple of times . 
happiness, Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me . 
happiness, Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide . 
happiness, Looking forward to meeting with you !

happiness," We are , 27 to 26 . "
happiness," Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . "
happiness," Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . "
happiness,"Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! "
happiness, It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . 
happiness,"What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! "
happiness," You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? "
happiness," From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? "
happiness, Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! 
happiness," Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . "
happiness," He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! "
happiness," She's chic , isn't she ? "
happiness," Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . "
happiness," It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . "
happiness, Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . 
happiness, Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . 
happiness, I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! 
happiness," The gown is quite expensive , believe me . "
happiness, So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . 
happiness, You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . 
happiness," You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . "
happiness, Thanks . I'm flattered . 
happiness," Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while . "
happiness, Hi Kate ... thanks ... wow ! Look at all the furniture . You must spent a fortune on it ! I love your new three-pieces suite . 
happiness, Good for you ! You ’ Ve got new curtains too . That ’ s a very nice shade of blue . This sofa is very comfortable . I could sit on it all day ! 
happiness, That's really my pleasure to listen to a Chinese song . 
happiness, Thank you very much for doing this interview . 
happiness, My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? 
happiness,The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat . 
happiness, That's a wonderful choice . 
happiness, I have chosen January as the month for this retreat . 
happiness, January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays . 
happiness," Yes , maybe another choice might be better . "
happiness, I think that April would work . Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains . 
happiness, Thank you for thinking of that . 
happiness, Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer . 
happiness, That is a good idea . 
happiness, I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers . 
happiness," Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . "
happiness,Hey ! I have a surprise for you . 
happiness, What is it ? 
happiness, Open this card and read . 
happiness,How do you like this waltz ? 
happiness, It's very nice . I like it very much . 
happiness," Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? "
happiness," My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often . "
happiness, I'm glad you say so . You dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got you as a partner . 
happiness, Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ? 
happiness, Yes . And what dances do you like best ? 
happiness," Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing . "
happiness," Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . "
happiness, My pleasure . 
happiness," I appreciate it , thank you . "
happiness, That ’ s all right . 
happiness," Yes . Nice to meet you , Mrs Smith . "
happiness," Nice to meet you too , Mr . Zhang . "
happiness," That ’ s great . If you don ’ t mind my asking , does your company give bonuses ? "
happiness, I hope you will ! Take your time . We have a lot more upstairs . 
happiness,Come here ! I can see the tall camphor trees from here . 
happiness, This is a great botanical garden in the city . 
happiness, Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music . 
happiness," Yeah , I agree.It makes you feel really good . "
happiness, Sure . I'm going to take more pictures today . 
happiness, You are so kind . Thanks . 
happiness," Thank you for telling me so much , I'll try them next time . "
happiness, I'm always at your service . 
happiness," Let me guess , Mocha , Mandheling , and Santos ! "
happiness," Yep , my own special blend ! You can tell by just smelling them ? "
happiness," No , I just read the names off the packages ... Ha ! "
happiness," Thank you , see you then . "
happiness, Oh it ’ s printed the ticket already . Thank you very much . 
happiness, You ’ re welcome . 
happiness," Great . When in Rome , you guys know what to do . "
happiness, That about does it . See you in a week . 
happiness," That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office . "
happiness, No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . 
happiness, Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed dress ? 
happiness, OK . Thank you . 
happiness, It's been nice talking to you . 
happiness, Good-bye . See you again sometime . 
happiness," That is so nice of you . If I like the service and the training equipment , I think I well join the club . "
happiness, Travel by the buses ? That sounds interesting . 
happiness, sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well . 
happiness, great . Let's go ! 
happiness," Well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! "
happiness," It ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ’ ll get lost . So when are you going to drop by ? "
happiness, That ’ s right . They tastes so good ! We eat them with mint sauce . Have you every tried them ? 
happiness," I certainly can . If I can get some from the butcher ’ s , I ’ ll cook them for you . "
happiness, That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine . 
happiness,"And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . "
happiness," Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . "
happiness," Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . "
happiness," No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . "
happiness," Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . "
happiness, And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . 
happiness," Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . "
happiness," Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . "
happiness, I realize that I ’ m not in a position to offer you the kind of promotion you deserve I'll gladly do what I can to help . 
happiness, Thank you . I ’ Ve really enjoyed my time here . I've grown both personally and professionally with this company .

happiness," Sure , Mike , I ’ d love to . "
happiness," No , that ’ s perfect . We can leave directly from here . "

happiness, The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go !

happiness, Cool ! 
happiness," Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . "
happiness," See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . "
happiness," That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? "
happiness, That's a relief ! I was a little worried about it ; I left England in a bit of a hurry . 
happiness," Oh , this feels very nice . It's perfect . I'll take it . "

happiness," What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? "
happiness, And the bank will offer you loans for twenty years ! 
happiness, Thanks a lot . 
happiness, You're welcome . 
happiness," Sure , it's multi-functional . Besides playing music , it can also be used to store documents and make recordings . "
happiness, Okay . 
happiness," Well . In that case , we will have to go to another restaurant . Thank you all the same . "
happiness," Wounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . "
happiness," An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . "
happiness," Indeed , you're exactly right ! "
happiness, Not at all . It's no problem . 
happiness, Thank you so much .

happiness, I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you buy any new furniture ? 
happiness, I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition . 
happiness," That ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . "

happiness," Have fun ! I plan to spend some more time with my grandkids , and I might even go back to school . "
happiness," 553-2213 . Great , thanks . "
happiness,"Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! "
happiness," Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . "
happiness," Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . "
happiness," Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . "
happiness," Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! "
happiness," That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! "
happiness, Great ! Thanks a lot ! 
happiness," No problem , John . "
happiness," Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back . "
happiness," Thank you , thank you , thanks again . "
happiness, Maybe now I ’ ll get that promotion I was hoping for .

happiness," Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . "
happiness, Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .

happiness," Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... "
happiness, Is everything ready now ? 
happiness," Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . "
happiness, Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . 
happiness," Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . "
happiness," It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . "

happiness, It can't be expressed by words . 
happiness,"Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . "
happiness," Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . "
happiness," Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . "
happiness," I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . "
happiness,"Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? "
happiness," Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . "
happiness," That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . "
happiness, Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . 
happiness," Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . "
happiness," Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . "
happiness, It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress . 
happiness,"Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . "
happiness, That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it . 
happiness, No problem . See you ! 
happiness, See you ! 
happiness," I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian . "
happiness, Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure ! 
happiness," Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you ! "
happiness," OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ... "
happiness," Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . "
happiness,Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . 
happiness, Then would you please go to a dance party with me ? 
happiness, With pleasure . I suppose you dance often . 
happiness," Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time . "
happiness, But I am told that you dance wonderfully well . 
happiness," Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ? "
happiness, Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ? 
happiness, OK .

happiness,"You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with . "

happiness," We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music . "
happiness," Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . "
happiness, How about the new bar across the road ? 
happiness, Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too . 
happiness," I agree , I had lunch there last week . "
happiness, Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . 
happiness," That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning . "
happiness, Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am . 
happiness,"Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town . "
happiness," Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight . "
happiness," Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ? "
happiness," Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer . "
happiness, Congratulations . How lucky you are ! 
happiness, Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning . 
happiness, I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . 
happiness, I ’ m sure I will . 
happiness," Have a nice journey , Lily . "
happiness," Thank you , David . "
happiness,Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won ! 
happiness," Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . "
happiness," Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . "
happiness," He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . "
happiness, Me too . 
happiness," Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . "
happiness," Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? "
happiness," Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited . "
happiness," He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . "
happiness, And the host announced that he won it all ! 
happiness, Thank you . I will go get one . 
happiness," Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government . "
happiness," Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win . "
happiness, Thanks you for the encouragement . 
happiness, You are welcome . I ’ d better go . Goodbye .
