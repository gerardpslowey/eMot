disgust,That woman is a thorough drag ! 
disgust, She keeps spitting on the ground . 
disgust,What a boring film ! 
disgust, The acting of the heroine is too artificial . 
disgust, And the plot is so simple . 
disgust, Not really . I thought it was disappointing . 
disgust, Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . 
disgust," All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! "
disgust," Well , I hate to have to say this , but I'm not happy with my room . "
disgust," Yes , it's my steak . "
disgust," It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium . "
disgust,"I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . "

disgust," Today , I am busy all day long . "
disgust, Any body piercing ? Stick out your tongue ! 
disgust," He's awful ! He telephoned me four times yesterday , and three times the day before yesterday . He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon . My boss answered the telephone . "
disgust," He said , Pauline is typing letters . She can't speak to you now ! "" Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again . But I didn ’ t answer the phone ! "
disgust," I said , This is Pauline's mother . Please don ’ t telephone my daughter again ! "
disgust,Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? 
disgust, It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . 
disgust," Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . "
disgust," That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . "
disgust," No , cats are too dirty . They are lazy and cunning . I don ’ t like them at all . "
disgust," You can keep the cat , but you should keep it away from me . "
disgust,You shouldn't let the dirty dishes accumulate in the sink ! 
disgust, He sounds like a sick cow ! 
disgust," Granted , it ’ s cheap , but the place is filthy , the beds are uncomfortable , there ’ s no A / C , the breakfast is pretty skimpy ... and the staff couldn ’ t care less about the guests . "

disgust," I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . "
disgust," Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . "
disgust,"Honey , the house is such a mess ! I need you to help me tidy up a bit . My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless ! "
disgust, You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ?
