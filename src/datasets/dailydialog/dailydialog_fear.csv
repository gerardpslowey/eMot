fear, i think i'll be a little afraid . 
fear, afraid of making a mistake . 
fear, But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? 
fear," Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . "

fear," Phew ! . . . Wait a minute , CRASH ? ? ! ! Spyware ? Trojans ! What ? where ? when ? ! "
fear, It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . 
fear, I'm bleeding too much . 
fear," Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! "
fear," No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . "
fear, I ... I failed to pass the examination . How I wish I had studied hard . 
fear, I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice . 
fear, I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . 
fear,"This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . "
fear," To tell you the truth , I'm really nervous . I had a dream last night that I was being interviewed by a three-headed monster that kept trying to bite my head off . Oh , wow , my palms are sweaty just thinking about it . I just hope Ms . Mendoza won't be able to hear my teeth chattering . I just hope I get through this in one piece . "
fear, I'm scared . 
fear," Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning . "
fear, This can ’ t wait ! I need your help now ! 
fear," He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does ! "

fear, Is it gonna hurt ? 
fear,That was really a nightmare ! 
fear, I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator . 
fear, I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . 
fear, I don ’ t know anything about the bills or laws they ’ re trying to pass . 
fear, Nobody told me that before . 
fear,"Mom , Dad ! Can you come to my room ? I think there is something under my bed ! "
fear, Now I know that something bad is up ! 
fear, I've told you a thousand times . I don't want to go in the Haunted House.It ' s too scary ! 
fear," Ah , thanks . "
fear, I am worrying about it too . I want to install a security door . 
fear," Oh , I hate having teeth pulled out . Will it hurt ? "
fear, I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? 
fear," It's me , Ali . There's this strange guy who keeps coming around . He's been here three times this week . "
fear, He makes me nervous . He looks at me funny . And he never buys anything ! 
fear, I am happy that you like the house . We should write down what we like so that we can remember it . 
fear, Hello ? Can you help me ? My computer ! Oh man ... 
fear," I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black ! "

fear, I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . 
fear," Really , it's so beautiful . "
fear," What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here ! "
fear, I can smell smoke ! 
fear, Gosh ! I can see the flames ! 
fear,"Oh , my god . What happened ? Are we dying ? "
fear, It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . 
fear," Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! "
fear," No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . "
fear, I wish everything in life was so simple . Thank you . 
fear," Not a problem , sir . Please remember us in the future . "
fear, You are scaring me ! 
fear, Too bad . I really like it .
