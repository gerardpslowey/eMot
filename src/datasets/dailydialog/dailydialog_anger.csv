anger,It smells like an ashtray in here ! 
anger, What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking .

anger, Fine ! I want a divorce ! 
anger, Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? 
anger," Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! "

anger, For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ? 
anger, You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people . 
anger," Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ? "
anger," With everything , with everybody , with all this ! "
anger, The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . 
anger, Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! 
anger," I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? "
anger, You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
anger," Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . "
anger, Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . 
anger, It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts . 
anger, She made another white crack about my clothes . 
anger,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
anger, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
anger," Oh , you men ! You're all the same . "
anger, That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? 
anger, it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! 
anger, That ’ s too much . 
anger," Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault.If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . "
anger," Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . "
anger,How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ? 
anger, I don ’ t want to . 
anger, Certainly not . 
anger, Turn on the radio ? What for ? 
anger, Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ? 
anger," To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop . "
anger, Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
anger,I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you . 
anger, How many chances should I give you ? I've given up on you ! 
anger, I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
anger, How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . 
anger, And let them ruin my life ? Forget it ! 
anger, I really want to take him over my knee . 
anger," Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train ! "
anger, Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else . 
anger," Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got . "
anger, You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it . 
anger, If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it . 
anger, That's absolutely ridiculous ! 
anger, How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . 
anger, I have been looking forward to this performance all month . 
anger,I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing ! 
anger, Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! 
anger,Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ? 
anger," Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb . "
anger," Oh right ... present company excluded , of course ! "
anger, What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up . 
anger,How annoying ! 
anger, Just what I thought ! 
anger," Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! "
anger," Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . "
anger, Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ? 
anger, Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing ! 
anger, I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! 
anger, How dare you speak to me like this . 
anger, Why not ? 
anger,I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? 
anger, It's really very easy saying you're sorry . 
anger," You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore "
anger," Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints . "
anger," You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . "
anger,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
anger, But you should tell me you were in love with her . 
anger, You know you didn't . 
anger," Yes , but you might have told me before . "
anger, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
anger," Oh , you men ! You are all the same . "
anger, She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ? 
anger,You ’ re making my blood boil . 
anger, I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter . 
anger, Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ? 
anger," Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough ! "
anger,I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that . 
anger, It is impossible . You cheated on me . 
anger, Shut up ! 
anger," But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't . "
anger, Leave me ! Go away ! 
anger, I am very grateful for your advice . 
anger, It's my pleasure to talk with you . 
anger, I don't think you really want to hear about it . 
anger," To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! "
anger," Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! "
anger," There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . "
anger," He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! "
anger, I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! 
anger,I really like the record you lent me the other day . 
anger, I'm glad you like it . 
anger, And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . 
anger, Not at all . 
anger, I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it . 
anger, I'm glad . 
anger," Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? "
anger, Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . 
anger, Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? 
anger, It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . 
anger, What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job . 
anger," How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . "
anger," It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . "
anger," Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . "
anger," Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had . "
anger," You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . "
anger, He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . 
anger, That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! 
anger," But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . "
anger, I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . 
anger, I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . 
anger, It is stupid to say so . 
anger,Bang ? ! Bang ! Bang ! What are the Kings doing at seven o ’ clock on Sunday morning ? 
anger,Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
anger, You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . 
anger,Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
anger, So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . 
anger," Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . "
anger, His name is not fat boy ! You can be so rude sometimes . 
anger,"Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ? "
anger, Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that . 
anger,I am fed up with Jack . He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt . 
anger, How do you know that I didn ’ t try ? I just couldn ’ t manage it . 
anger,You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! 
anger, Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . 
anger," They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . "
anger, They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 
anger, You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! 
anger, Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . 
anger," They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . "

anger, They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 
anger,I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! 
anger," That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! "
anger," Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? "
anger,"So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything . "
anger," Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill ! "
anger," What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? "
anger,Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge . 
anger, It ’ s infuriating . I have to be in Rome by five . 
anger,"Bob , I'm really upset with you . "
anger, You forgot it last year as well . 
anger," I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! "
anger," He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! "
anger," Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ? "
anger, I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life ! 
anger, No way ! Please don't follow me around . 
anger,You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are ! 
anger, Sure . You look like you're all black and blue . 
anger, I'm not at all convinced . Tomorrow is Saturday ! 
anger, Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it . 
anger, Are you done ? 
anger,I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike . 
anger,You didn't ring me last night.You said you would . 
anger, That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
anger, And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 
anger,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! "
anger, It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
anger, Don't brother me ! 
anger,"Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look ! "
anger, No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me ! 
anger," you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! "
anger," No , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? "
anger," You know , it's OK for a girl to forget these "" big days "" , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . "
anger," The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! "
anger, It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! 
anger, He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! 
anger," Ur , you really let me down . "
anger," No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . "
anger," Ur , you really let me down . "
anger," No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . "
anger, How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . 
anger, Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? 
anger,Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
anger, You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . 
anger,When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . 
anger,"I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ? "
anger, I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man ! 
anger, For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? 
anger, We ’ re doomed ! 
anger, Peter ! Pack them . Don't read them . 
anger," Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late . "
anger," why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? "

anger," I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! "
anger, They both just talk about how great they are all the time . 
anger, They soud like the neighbours from hell ! 
anger," They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . "
anger," Really , Mary , you ’ re horrible . "
anger," Why don ’ t you marry Rose , then ? "
anger, We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! 
anger," You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . "
anger,It's taking you forever to do my hair . 
anger, You should've been done already . 
anger, I don't think that you're done . 
anger, My hair looks hideous . 
anger, It doesn't look good at all . 
anger, I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . 
anger,Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour ! 
anger," Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore ! "
anger,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
anger, I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
anger,Look at what you have done . All thumbs . 
anger, Waiter ! 
anger," I've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service . "
anger,"Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! "
anger, What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! 
anger, my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend ! 
anger, you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work ! 
anger, Didn ’ t I tell you ? It ’ s over ! 
anger," It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! "
anger," No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home ! "
anger," I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . "
anger, I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! 
anger, I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around . 
anger," You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! "
anger, Just get out of my face ! 
anger, Leave me alone ! 
anger,What a terrible house ! 
anger," The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! "
anger,I know I ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill . I almost got killed on the chair lift ! This is going to be so embarrassing . 
anger, No ! ! ! 
anger, Easy ? Ha ! ! It was easy for them to cheat you ! !

anger," The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . "
anger, I'll beat him . 
anger,I ’ m itching for moving ! 
anger," It ’ s so wet and dark , I ’ m just fed up . "
anger,"This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time . "
anger, No way . I've given you too many chances already . 
anger, Don't brother me ! 
anger, How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . 
anger, You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! 
anger, Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! 
anger, You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
anger, I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . 
anger, You should feel shameful for your behavior . 
anger, Didn't I tell you ? It's over ! 
anger," It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! "
anger," No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home ! "
anger," I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone . "
anger, I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around . 
anger, What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . 
anger, Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho ! 
anger,What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . 
anger, what a bummer ! You set me up ? 
anger, how dare you ! 
anger,They promised us a sea view . 
anger, Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . 
anger,It's terrible how things have changed.You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . 
anger," No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for Drin "
anger," I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . "
anger, Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves . 
anger," Shut up . You should think how to make fortunes , not look for a squabble . "
anger," No , I just check my weight , I'm getting fatter . "
anger,You're spending a very long time on my hair . 
anger, Are you sure you're finished ? 
anger, You did a horrible job on my hair . 
anger,"Emily , what kind of report is this ? "
anger," Don't get smart with me . Here , do it again , but do it right this time . "
anger," This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! "
anger,Look what you've done ! 
anger," Yes , and hurry up ! "
anger," Yes , and please be more careful in the future ! "
anger,"I really don't know how to break this to you , but it ’ s eating me alive ! "
anger," But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late . "
anger," But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ? "
anger, But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? 
anger," No , you must stay ! I swear it , and the oath shall be kept . "
anger, I tell you I must go ! 
anger, I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion . 
anger, I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return . 
anger, Quiet everybody ! 
anger,My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief . 
anger, Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad . 
anger," Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings . "
anger, I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! 
anger,You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ? 
anger, You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her . 
anger," It's too late to say sorry now.Oh , what am I going to do ? "
anger, That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? 
anger,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! "
anger, It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
anger,Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long 
anger," Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . "
anger," What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me ! "
anger, I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car ! 
anger," I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! "
anger," That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! "
anger, That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
anger, And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 
anger, addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! 
anger," Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! "
anger, I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . 
anger," 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! "
anger, I won't be paying you for this . 
anger," You don ’ t love me , Roy . "
anger," No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . "
anger, I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . 
anger," Oh , shut up , Roy . "
anger," Oh , SHUT UP ! "
anger,Joan is a thorough drag ! 
anger," Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! "
anger, But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . 
anger, I don't care . 
anger,I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . 
anger, What did you think you were doing ? 
anger, How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . 
anger,You didn't tell me she was married ! 
anger, I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! 
anger," The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . "
anger,Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! 
anger," I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! "
anger," Just get out of my face , would you ? "
anger, Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ? 
anger, Get out of here ! 
anger," Oh , gag me ! She's totally gross ! "
anger,I hate to see the abuse of animals . 
anger, It makes me sick . 
anger, You ! 
anger, You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? 
anger, Don't bother . 
anger, My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! 
anger," Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . "
anger,I have a bone to pick with you . 
anger, You always have a chip on your shoulder . 
anger,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable ! 
anger, He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
anger," I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . "
anger, We ’ re in the same boat ! I ’ Ve eaten fast food the whole week . I hate it now . 
anger,How could you have done that without asking me first ? 
anger,It smells like an ashtray in here ! 
anger, What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . 
anger," Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . "
anger, Fine ! I want a divorce ! 
anger, Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . 
anger," Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . "
anger,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
anger, But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
anger, You know you didn't . 
anger," Yes , but you might have told me before . "
anger, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
anger," Oh , you men ! You're all the same . "
anger, Absolutely not ! I'm not a thief . 
anger,Did you hear what she said to me ? 
anger, What do you think I should do about it ? 
anger,"I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . "
anger, You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is . 
anger," Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! "
anger,I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . 
anger,I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . 
anger, What did you think you were doing ? 
anger, How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . 
anger," I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! "
anger," He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! "
anger, Just get out of my face ! 
anger, Leave me alone ! 
anger,Congratulations on the new house ! 
anger, Thanks ! We love it . 
anger," Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful . "
anger," I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? "
anger, And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . 
anger,"Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . "
anger," I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . "
anger, But how guilty to waste food ! 
anger, Why ? It's in mint condition ! 
anger, I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me ! 
anger, Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise . 
anger,Do you have any idea what time it is ? 
anger," If you do this again , don't even bother coming home . "
anger," Well , if I'm not living here anymore , then I won't have to listen to your rules . "
anger, You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . 
anger, Who knows ! That might come to later . 
anger, I can't stand riding the bus . 
anger," Me too , it's so unreliable . "
anger, It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather . 
anger, Exactly.That ' s the worst part . 
anger,The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! 
anger," Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! "
anger,"Mom , I hate eating vegetables ! "
anger, But I don ’ t like them.It ’ s not fair . 
anger, You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! 
anger," Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? "
anger,"What a mess , Jack ! "
anger," I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . "
anger, You said you were only going to window shop ! 
anger," I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! "
anger, You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? 
anger, I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! 
anger," I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! "
anger," Oh , this one is perfect . "
anger,"Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . "
anger, It's none of your business . 
anger, I'm going out anyway . Get out of my way . 
anger," Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! "
anger," He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! "
anger, I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! 
anger," Look , traffic jam again ! "
anger,Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . 
anger," This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . "
anger, So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . 
anger, I was late for work because of them . 
anger, I want my money back for the delivery . 
anger, Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! 
anger, it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own . 
anger, I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches ! 
anger," yes , they were horrible . We had to wear green every day ! "
anger," At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? "
anger," But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? "
anger," But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? "
anger," Oh , come on ! Don't be so sour . These are beautiful shirts . I know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself . "
anger, Are you crazy ? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ? 
anger, Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have ? 
anger, Come on mom . I'm your A ! Wait till the guys hear about this ! 
anger,Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head ! 
anger," That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . "
anger," I don't need your help , jerk . "
anger,"Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . "
anger,"May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere . "
anger, I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right . 
anger," I wish he could understand . You know what , if this goes on , I think I will get stick like everybody else . "
anger, Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house . 
anger, Yes . I can't find my sweater . I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done . I find my swatter missing . 
anger, Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! 
anger, Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . 
anger, Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! 
anger," When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! "
anger, You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . 
anger," Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! "
anger,this bloody computer ! 
anger, my computer just crashed again for the third time today ! 
anger," oh , no ! I thought it seemed a bit strange . "
anger,"Oh , the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat , ur ... it was like leather . "
anger, Yes . And they don ’ t give you very much either . I ’ m still hungry . 
anger, I ’ m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant . 
anger, Don ’ t do this ! Don ’ t do that ! You mustn ’ t do this ! You can ’ t do that ! 
anger," Well , I ’ m going to write a letter of complaint . "
anger, And we ’ ll all help you . 
anger,"This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . "
anger, They arrested me for nothing . 
anger, They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me . 
anger, They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning . 
anger, They sure did . 
anger, I want to take them to court . 
anger,Shut up ... Billy ... BILLY ! 
anger, I've had enough . 
anger,I have a complaint to make . I've just been badly treated by a rude maid . 
anger,"I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . "
anger, It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . 
anger," I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . "
anger," First I was late for school this morning , and now I broke your vase . This isn't my day ! "
anger," Which leg do you want to have , right leg or left one ? "
anger,I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer . 
anger," But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . "
anger," Make it work , Geoff . You would say that , wouldn ’ t you , he is your cousin.what a jerk , make me hire your stupid , useless , cousin . "
anger, I want to take them to court for arresting me . 
anger, There was no reason for them to arrest me . 
anger, They released me the next morning . 
anger, That ’ s exactly what they did . 
anger, I ’ m definitely taking them to court . 
anger, It's unfair . 
anger, Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years . 
anger, I got the message . I'm quiting . 
anger," I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time.If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . "
anger," Very well , consider me gone . "
anger, I don't care . I have a headache . 
anger,"Listen , Christine , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . "
anger, I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you ! 
anger," Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . "
anger,Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mike ! 
anger," If I hear "" Love Me Tender "" one more time , I think I'm going to go crazy ! "
anger,We are through . 
anger," Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day . "
anger," But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home . "
anger, You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone . 
anger, I don't buy a story . 
anger," No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again . "
anger, Are you kidding me ? 
anger," You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? "
anger," We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . "
anger, I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ? 
anger," Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well ! "
anger, I am really looking forward to getting away from you . Far away from you ! 
anger," No , we got no receipt , but we paid on the spot . "
anger, I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . 
anger, No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? 
anger, You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! 
anger,I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need ! 
anger, You don't know what you are asking ! 
anger,What a terrible house ! 
anger," The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking "
anger," There's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! "
anger," It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it ! "
anger,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
anger, I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
anger, What ! I resent that ! 
anger,I don't understand why I'm being arrested . 
anger, A warrant for what ? 
anger, What does that mean ? 
anger, I wasn't aware that I had to go to court . 
anger, I don't find this fair . 
anger, Don't I have any rights ? 
anger, Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? 
anger," What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . "
anger," Get out of my store , you jerk ! "
anger, It certainly didn't arrive here that way . 
anger,Hello ! We ’ Ve been waiting for our lunch order for over an hour . Did you forget our order ? 
anger," I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! "
anger,I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking . 
anger," How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you . "
anger, It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility . 
anger, Even if I was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment . 
anger, I just don't trust you any more . 
anger, That's true . You can hear my tummy grumbling . I am really hungry ! 
anger," Let me go to school , please ! I'm sick of medicine , sick of soup , and sick of being sick ! "
anger, But nobody uses Macintosh ! 
anger, Do you think I believe the story like that ? 
anger, How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? 
anger, Don't you dare tell me that ... 
anger," Well , they should have called you ! "
anger, And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ? 
anger, It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets ! 
anger, Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations ! 
anger, I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! 
anger," Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! "
anger," Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food ! "
anger, But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! 
anger," Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! "
anger, That ’ s so unfair ! 
anger, Silly boy ! The dustbin is at the back of the school . Now pick up the paperand put it in the dustbiri . 
anger,I'm going crazy . 
anger," Whatever . Just turn right here . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . let ’ s take a side street . Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! "
anger, What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! 
anger, Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ? 
anger, I wasn't done talking to you . 
anger," I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey . "
anger, I really don't think it's any of your business . 
anger, That's not nice . 
anger, You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement ! 
anger, Don ’ t tell me what to do ! I ’ ll get to it when I get around to it ! 
anger," Shut up ! Now you are in my car , you should listen to me . Or you can get off . I've told you I'm in a hurry . I don't want to waste time on the road . "
anger, Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages . 
anger, It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . 
anger, It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . 
anger," Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! "
anger," It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . "
anger," That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! "
anger," Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable . "
anger,I have to talk to you ! 
anger," I know , Blake . But you ’ Ve been avoiding me all morning , and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company . "
anger,Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? 
anger," Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . "
anger," Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . "
anger, What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation ? 
anger," You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us ! "
anger, Really ? Who made that rule up ? 
anger," With that attitude , I don't really think we have much more to discuss here . "
anger, That works for me ! 
anger," If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don't feel like dodging cars and scooters ! "
anger, What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! 
anger," You ’ re questioning my ability ? I tell ya , I can make it ! I ’ ll talk to your boss . "
anger, You think so ? Let ’ s take a chance ! 
anger,"Ann , it's terrible ! "
anger, I think it's because of your bad habits ! 
anger,I know why Mr . Fro didn't like our ad idea ! He doesn't know the first thing about coffee . 
anger, Why don ’ t you help me save money ? You are always spending money . 
anger," Yes , I joined your group of bus tour this morning . You promised the journey will last 3 hours and we will visit 15 sightseeing spots . "
anger, But have 2 - hour journey . 
anger," Oh , no ! "
anger," I can wait , but my toothache can't ! "
anger,I'll be late because I have waited so long ! 
anger, I ’ d like to know why you ’ re always taking credit for work we ’ Ve done together like that line in the new Ice Cream ad ? 
anger," That was my line , Mark . I know we worked on the ad together , but that was definitely my line . "
anger, Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . 
anger," Look for it yourself , please ! Kinda busy here , Daniel ! "
anger,"I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight ! "
anger, Cockroaches have declared war on my room ! 
anger,Look at the traffic . It ’ s terrible ! 
anger,I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . 
anger, That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night . 
anger, Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves . 
anger,Do you know how late it is ? 
anger, Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ? 
anger," Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside . "
anger," That's fine , because if I leave , then your rules won't matter . "
anger,Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
anger," No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . "
anger," Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . "
anger, Damn ! 
anger, You said the same thing three months ago . 
anger," This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! "
anger," Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway . "
anger, I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . 
anger, That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! 
anger, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 
anger, I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
anger, What did I do ? I haven't done anything . 
anger, I didn't do anything . 
anger," No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . "
anger," I don't need your help , jerk . "
anger, His face broke out and he said it was my fault ! 
anger,Why aren ’ t they are aware of the gravity of the situation ? 
anger,The washing machine isn't working again . 
anger, Dammit ! I asked for sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . 
anger," Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault . If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . "
anger," Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . "
anger,Oh . I just wanted you to shut up . You were off-key anyway . Let me see that ! 
anger,Could you please stop flipping the channels ? 
anger,"Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus . "
anger,I'm very annoyed at your disobedience . 
anger, You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday . 
anger," Oh , don't you ? God save me ! "
anger, I dislike my roommate . He really turns me off . 
anger, See you . 
anger,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable . 
anger, He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
anger," I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me . "
anger, Curse this oven ! Curse it ! 
anger, Curse the worst oven in the world . 
anger, I haven't even told you what it is yet ! 
anger," Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! "
anger, That ’ s so unfair ! 
anger, Forget it ! It was a bitter pill for me to swallow . 
anger, I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches ! 
anger, What ? You're overcharging me ! 
anger, Try to be more careful in future . Look ! You ’ Ve damaged the sign . 
anger, Stop picking on me . I am going to be mad . 
anger, My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! 
anger, Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . 
anger,Ouch ! I'm hurt . 
anger, that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? 
anger, Get out of it ! It wasn't as good as you think . 
anger,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . 
anger," yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . "
anger, but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? 
anger," Well , I hate to disturb you , but I really can't stand it any more . Can you change my room for me ? It's too noisy . I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . It was too much for me . "
anger, You ’ re a liar ! 
anger, Why ? You can't be always so lazy . 
anger, I want to file a complaint . 
anger, A man robbed me today . 
anger, How dare you question my statement ! 
anger,"Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... "
anger," I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ... "
anger," Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just give me my money ! "
anger," No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No ! "
anger," All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better ! "
anger, Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! 
anger, Mom ! That is so unfair ! 
anger, I don ’ t want to hear it ! Now go to your room ! 
anger,"Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! "
anger,Why am I being arrested ? 
anger, I don't have a warrant . 
anger, I don't know what a bench warrant is . 
anger, I was never told to go to court . 
anger, This isn't fair . 
anger, What about my rights ? 
anger, I told you to hurry up a thousand times . You just put a deaf ear to it . 
anger, It's all your fault ! Now we can't get in shopping . 
anger,Why are you arresting me ? 
anger, What kind of warrant ? 
anger, What is that ? 
anger, I never went to court . 
anger, This is unfair . 
anger," I have rights , don't I ? "
anger,My stomach's growling again ! 
anger, They arrested me without probable cause . 
anger, They had no reason for arresting me . 
anger, I want justice . 
anger, How depressed ! 
anger, Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle . 
anger, Why are you so bitter ? No one tells worse joke than you . 
anger,Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ? 
anger, You can't do that ! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made ! 
anger," Well , now I've seen it all ! What a rip-off this place is ! "
anger," But what ? You always act like this , when you face difficulties . "
anger,"Oh , my goodness . The traffic is crawling . "
anger, You can ’ t just throw me out on the street ! 
anger," Well , there's nothing I can do about my height ! "
anger,Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! 
anger, Who's your manager ? Tell me ! Would you ? 
anger," Oh , how annoying ! "
anger, Is's infuriating ! I have to be in Rome by five . 
anger, That's not fair ! 
anger, We have to wait six more minutes ! 
anger, You said the same thing three months ago . 
anger, You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ? 
anger, I got the message . I am quitting . 
anger, It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . 
anger, It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . 
anger,Excuse me . Who is the person responsible for handling complaints here ? I would like to make a few complaints . 
anger," Here is the thing . I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night . Even I unplugged it , it wouldn't stop beeping . I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room . So I want to change to a cleaner and quieter room . "
anger,What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . 
anger," Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! "
anger," Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . "
anger,"My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one . "
anger, That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night . 
anger, Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ? 
anger, This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again ! 
anger, I don't get it . I'll go and have that doorman talk to you then . 
anger,Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic ! 
anger," If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy ! "
anger, He sounds like a sick cow ! 
anger, At least I enjoy my lunch ! What's in your bag ? 
anger," There's the difference , your wife made it ! I have to make my own lunch ! "
anger,"Gordon , you're ever so late . "
anger," But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . "
anger, How on earth can you miss several buses ? 
anger," Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? "
anger, I am not convinced by your explanation . 
anger," Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . "
anger, Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
anger, To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
anger, To hell with you . 
anger," Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . "
anger," Well , I'm really surprised . You are not doing anything behind my back , are you ? "
anger," Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! "
anger," Yes , I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back . "
anger, That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now . 
anger, Come on ! What have you got to lose ? 
anger, It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! 
anger, Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . 
anger," Peter , it's a quarter to twelve . Let's go home now ! "
anger, I can ’ t possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours ! 
anger, It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . 
anger," Oh , how annoying ! "
anger, What a nuisance ! 
anger," No , we got no receipt , and we pay it on the spot ! "
anger,"John , I ’ Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ’ t want to see you smoking in my office again . "
anger," That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! "
anger," No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh . "
anger, So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it . 
anger," No , thank you . "
anger," Cash , credit card , cheque anything . I just have to see a doctor . I am in pain . "
anger, I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . 
anger," You've just scratched my car . Oh , God , a paint was scratched off . "
anger," No , mine ! "
anger, I am maintaining the building . You are way too picky ! 
anger, You wouldn ’ t dare do that ! 
anger," I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! "
anger," Oh , yes , I would ! "
anger," You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here ! "
anger, You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it ! 
anger, And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house ! 
anger, I would like to file a complaint . 
anger, I was robbed . 
anger," I just told you , Debbie . I tried to call you twenty times ! "
anger," Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball . "
anger," Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . "
anger," Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . "
anger,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . 
anger, I can ’ t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ’ s no laughing matter . 
anger," Well , you should be sorry ! Don ’ t ever use my computer again ! You can ’ t do anything now , it ’ s too late ! "
anger, That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! 
anger, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 
anger, I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
anger, There are nine cockroaches in my room . I don't have time for your disbelief ! 
anger, I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! 
anger," This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! "
anger, Damn it ! I think I'm going to miss the plane . 
anger," Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! "
anger," It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . "
anger," That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! "
anger, That's sheer robbery ! 
anger, Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now ! 
anger,"This room is unfit for humans . I want another room , and I want a refund for tonight . "
anger," In a word , cockroaches ! "
anger,Susan ! Why didn ’ t you tell me that you were taking over the Silk Company account ? 
anger, You know I wasn ’ t at the meeting . I was meeting with Mr . Wei about this account . I ’ Ve been on this for a month and a half . 
anger, I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . 
anger," This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . "
anger, I really do hate public transportation . 
anger," I agree , it's just never on time . "
anger, I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather . 
anger," Oh , that's the worst . "
anger,Excuse me . This chicken doesn't taste right to me . 
anger, How should I know ? It's just kind of cold in the middle . It just doesn't taste right . Do you want to try it ? 
anger,"And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . "
anger," Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . "
anger," I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! "
anger," I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! "
anger," Listen , I know who you are . If you call this number again , I ’ ll call the police . You ’ ll be arrested . I ’ Ve got your number . "
anger," Dad , it's not fair . I am so disappointed with you ! "
anger, Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now ! 
anger, Fine ! What do you need ? 
anger, I have made a reservation for my breakfast last night . But I still haven't got it . I am so hungry now . 
anger," Oh , yes . I get six Korean channels but nothing in English ! "
anger," What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd ! "
anger," Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . "
anger, That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! 
anger," Yes , you should have . "
anger, Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . 
anger, Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! 
anger,Ouch ! The water's too hot ! 
anger, Oh ... I'm sweating already . It's so hot . I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ? 
anger, Your inspector needs spectacles . The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant . 
anger, Not back home for dinner again ? That ’ s the third time this week ! 
anger,Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
anger," Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . "
anger, Damn ! 
anger, That sucks . I'd be pissed if that happened to me . 
anger," Oh my gosh . Damn ... screw the court , I would burn down their store . "
anger, Excuse me ? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard . 
anger, You're going to make me rich by not paying me ? 
anger, It's your fault for mixing the two broths ! 
anger,"Shit , so crowded ! "
anger, We have too many cars ! 
anger,Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! 
anger," I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! "
anger, Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . 
anger, This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning . 
anger, Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
anger, To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
anger, To hell with you . 
anger,How come it is slow as a snail today ? 
anger," Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly . "
anger," Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ? "
anger," I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! "
anger," Oh , yes , I would ! "
anger,What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . 
anger," Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . "
anger, What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . 
anger,You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw . 
anger," Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night . "
anger, Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ? 
anger, This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police ! 
anger," Give me a break , Mr Yang . "
anger, But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it . 
anger, I ’ m not kidding . 
anger,We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! 
anger, You can't be serious ! 
anger," Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . "
anger," After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . "
anger, Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case . 
anger," You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! "
anger, Whatever you say ! 
anger, I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn . 
anger, He is really outrageous . 
anger," Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . "
anger, I shouted it back of course . 
anger," No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . "
anger, I am too angry to do that . 
anger, I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals . 
anger," Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please . "
anger, I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding . 
anger, There ’ s no way that I can stay here . 
anger, But I ’ m not able to live here anymore . 
anger," Mike , you're late again . "
anger, Do you think I believe the story like that ? 
anger, How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? 
anger," Oh , honey ! Don ’ t you remember this important day to us ? "
anger,I hate doing the damn laundry . 
anger, We ’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ? 
anger,Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this . 
anger," My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep . "
anger," Oh , my dear sister , I am no longer a baby ! "
anger," Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more . "
anger," Get out of my store , you jerk ! "
anger,I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ? 
anger, You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? 
anger," I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up . "
anger," Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . "
anger, No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . 
anger,"Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... "
anger," I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ... "
anger," Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just gimme my money ! "
anger," No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No ! "
anger," No , no way ! What happened ? Give me my money ! "
anger," Aw , Mom-you're such a drag . "
anger,"I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time "
anger, Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ? 
anger," Don ’ t be kidding , OK ? "
anger, Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over . 
anger," You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? "
anger," And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! "
anger, Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! 
anger, Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! 
anger," Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! "
anger," Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? "
anger, I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
anger,Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? 
anger," Yeah , I'm afraid so . "
anger," If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . "
anger," Yes , it is annoying . "
anger,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
anger, But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
anger, You know you didn't . 
anger," Yes , but you might have told me before . "
anger, You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
anger," Oh , you men ! You're all the same . "
anger,It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . 
anger,Why don't you watch where you're going ? 
anger, There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . 
anger, It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . 
anger, Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
anger, It really hurts . 
anger, To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
anger, To hell with you . 
anger, Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
anger, what a bummer ! You set me up ? 
anger, That's crossing the line . 
anger, But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation . 
anger," I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . "
anger, Fine . I ’ ll take the compact . 
anger," Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . "
anger, I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit ! 
anger, Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! 
anger," Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! "
anger, Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! 
anger, Copycat ! 
anger," You went out and bought khakis , too ! "
anger, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
anger," Oh , you men ! You are all the same . "
anger, I don't want to . 
anger, Certainly not . 
anger, Turn on the TV for what ? 
anger," Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? "
anger,I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking . 
anger, How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more . 
anger,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is . "
anger, Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
anger, What a bummer ! You set me up ? 
anger, How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) 
anger, Why did you lie to me in the email ? 
anger, I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . 
anger, You dare to doubt me ? 
anger, You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? 
anger, I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! 
anger," I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! "
anger,"Oh , come on , Ultraman ! "
anger," Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either ! "
anger,What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
anger, I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
anger,We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! 
anger, Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty ! 
anger," I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! "
anger, Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish ! 
anger, Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon ! 
anger," What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... "
anger, Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon ! 
anger, Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday . 
anger, Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me . 
anger,Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more . 
anger, I dare you to say that again . 
anger," Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch ! "
anger," I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . "
anger," It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . "
anger, I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her . 
anger, Shame on you ! 
anger,We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future . 
anger,Mom ! I hate eating vegetables ! 
anger, But I don ’ t like them ! It ’ s not fair ! 
anger, Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying . 
anger,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! 
anger, He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
anger," I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . "
anger," Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . "
anger,"Staying out all night , you frightened me to death . "
anger, You should at least give me a call . 
anger," You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else ! "
anger," Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out ! "
anger, Just what gives you the right ... ? 
anger," Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady . "
anger, Whew ! I got the last one . This must be my lucky day ! 
anger," Lady ! This is unfair ! I've been cheated ! I was in line before you.That should have been my ticket ! Come on , hand it over , lady ! "
anger," Gentleman ! Hah ! Fat chance ! Hah ! Eat your heart out , sucker ! Hah ! "
anger, Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways . 
anger,What a terrible house ! 
anger," The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . "
anger, Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus . 
anger,the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! 
anger," on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . "
anger, It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves 
anger," Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track . "
anger," Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom ! "
anger, Yuck ! 
anger, You can ’ t do that ! It ’ s illegal ! 
anger, I need to file a complaint . 
anger, I got robbed . 
anger," Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . "
anger, Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song ! 
anger,"Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! "
anger, It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
anger,"Oh , damn . There ’ s another traffic jam on the highway . "
anger, Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother . 
anger,Man ! That car almost hit me ! 
anger,"Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting my main dish for quite a time . "
anger, Isn't that a bit excessive ? 
anger," This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . "
anger, Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ? 
anger, Why ? I still wanted to talk to you . 
anger, Don't be nosey . 
anger, That's harsh . 
anger, Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon ! 
anger," What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... "
anger, Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon ! 
anger,How slowly you drive ! 
anger, Uh ! Dad ! 
anger," I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now . "
anger," Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can . "
anger, It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . 
anger, It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight .
