# Scripts

The install scripts in this directory will create a Python venv, download the requirements and pull the scrapinghub/splash docker image.

The start scripts will activate the Python venv, and run the docker image.

The install and start script depends on your operating system.

1. Mac OS = macInstall.sh and macStart.sh
2. Linux OS = linuxInstall.sh and linuxStart.sh
3. Windows OS = windowsInstall.sh and windowsStart.sh

## Installation issues

If you can't download the project on Mac OS and pyqt5 specifically, your OS version could be too old. You can refer to the following link otherwise for troubleshooting:
